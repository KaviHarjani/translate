    <string name="tunnel_config_wildcard_description">Activate this switch if you wish to use wildcards in your filtering rules.

When enabled, Blokada will look at your request log, and dynamically generate a list that only contains rules that actually blocked at least one request. The Smart List is updated daily at night. Please note that you may experience a higher number of unwanted requests being allowed during the learning period (a few days). Please note that this is an experimental feature, and may not work properly.</string>
